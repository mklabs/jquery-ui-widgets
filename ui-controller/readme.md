jQuery UI Controller Widget
================================
A jQuery UI Widget that provides you clean and handy way to organise your jQuery code. 
Controllers organize event handlers through the power of event delegation. If something happens 
in your application, either it is browser event or custom ones, a controller should respond to it.

* Controllers let you know where your code is!

* Controllers force you to group events and label your html in specific ways. 

* Controllers are inheritable.

* Controllers use event delegation.

Please note that this widget is mostly about experience in trying to apply some code organization patterns in a jQuery / jQuery UI context. It was done in about one weekend, the main purpose was to tackle some issue we experienced with javascript and frontend architecture in my current project.

They're a lot of stuff of going on out there in this field, with the emergence of newly and truly brilliant framwork such as [eyeballs.js](http://github.com/paulca/eyeballs.js). or [backbone](http://github.com/documentcloud/backbone). [JavascriptMVC](http://www.javascriptmvc.com/) might sound a little bit heavier, but they are present for more than two years.

This widget is no longer maintened (heh, I'm not even sure it ever was ;), certainly buggy, not production-ready (aha, I hate this word) and works only on IE6... (just kidding).

It was a really good exercise to me, try to find solutions and code hard is one of the best training we have.
